model.r is the actual model. It is a work in progress, but it includes the file reading and importing, checking LINE assumptions, selecting variables, model building, diagnostics, etc.
THEdatascraper.py is what I use to scrape relevant team data from stathead.com. 
Masterfile is the excel file containing the scraped data. Hometeam data is in the hometeam sheet, and same for the away team.
